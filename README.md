# BotKit Support

A customer-support bot: intake, tickets, FAQ and SLA accounting.

## What it does

Part of a family of nine production Telegram bots on Python. Support is the one that has to be answerable: an SLA is a promise about response time, so the bot measures elapsed time against business hours rather than against wall-clock time alone.

The testing guide is the substantial document in this repository: it documents the test markers, the offline-versus-network split, and how to run the opt-in real-Telegram E2E suite.

## Features

- **Intake and ticket creation** — A conversation becomes a ticket with a trackable state.
- **FAQ over a knowledge base** — Common questions answered from a maintained knowledge base.
- **Escalation to an operator** — Cases past the bot's competence are handed to a human, with context attached.
- **SLA accounting with business hours** — `SLA_REPLY_MINUTES` and `SLA_CLOSE_HOURS` define the window the clock actually runs in (`src/sla/scheduler.py`).
- **SLA timer scheduler** — Timers are scheduled, not polled, so an SLA breach is detected when it happens.
- **Admin panel, broadcast (`/send`), anti-flood, `/metrics`, Sentry** — The operational surface every bot in this family carries.

## Stack

- Python 3.12+
- aiogram 3.x
- SQLAlchemy 2 (async) + SQLite (WAL) / PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Prometheus `/metrics`
- Sentry
- Docker, webhook (prod) / polling (dev)

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # fill in BOT_TOKEN and ADMIN_IDS
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m src.bot
```

Requires **Python 3.12** and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Copy
`.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the bot token and admin ids before starting.

## Configuration

Every variable is declared in [`.env.example`](.env.example); nothing is read that
is not declared there.

| Variable | Required | Holds a secret |
|---|---|---|
| `ADMIN_IDS` | yes | no |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | yes | yes |
| `BOT_TOKEN` | yes | yes |
| `DB_PATH` | no | no |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | no |
| `METRICS_PORT` | no | no |
| `REDIS_URL` | no | no |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | no | yes |
| `SLA_CLOSE_HOURS` | no | no |
| `SLA_REPLY_MINUTES` | no | no |

"Holds a secret" is classified by variable name, not by reading the value. Treat every `yes` as sensitive regardless.

Secrets never enter git: `.env` is ignored, and CI runs a gitleaks gate over the
history.

## Running in production

The bot runs behind a webhook with TLS and a health check. `deploy/` holds the
production compose file and its own `.env.example`.

```bash
cd deploy && cp .env.example .env   # fill in, then bring the stack up
```

## Testing

```bash
pytest
```

138 test functions across 25 files run offline in
CI — no Telegram account and no network. Tests that need either are marked `req`
and stay skipped unless `RUN_TELEGRAM_E2E=1` is set, so a fresh clone is green with
no secrets.

The full guide is **[README-testing.md](README-testing.md)**: test markers, the offline-versus-network split, the opt-in real-Telegram E2E suite, and the webhook secret contract.

CI also gates the lockfile (`uv lock --check`), runs gitleaks over the history,
scans the filesystem with Trivy, and validates the k6 load script.

## How this is built

```
src/
├── admin/  handlers.py
├── core/  auth.py, bot_factory.py, callbacks.py, config.py, database.py, errors.py
├── sla/  scheduler.py
└── support/  handlers.py, service.py
```

`botkit-core` is a separate published library carrying the shared runtime. This
repository depends on it by tag, not by path — see `pyproject.toml`.

## Backups

Backups and restore are a production-wide concern (systemd timers, offsite restic,
one Redis shared across bots), not a script inside a repository. The current
procedure and its caveats live in
[`botkit-monitoring/ops/backup/RESTORE.md`](https://github.com/ninelegsdog/botkit-monitoring/blob/main/ops/backup/RESTORE.md).

## Development process

This project was built in an AI-native process: the implementation was produced by
coding agents under human-led engineering control — requirement slots, constraints
and acceptance criteria defined in advance, then specification, generation, run,
check, fix.

My role in the project:

- product definition and user-facing scenarios;
- decomposition into independent engineering stages;
- context engineering: the instructions, constraints and working rules agents run under;
- management of the context window between iterations;
- the loop of specification → generation → run → verification → correction;
- validation, testing and review;
- control of repository structure, configuration, documentation and run reproducibility.

Implementation code was generated with AI coding agents under human-led engineering
control. The full description of the process, the `AGENTS.md` template, and the
review checklists for AI-written code and secrets are in
[agentic-development-playbook](https://github.com/ninelegsdog/agentic-development-playbook).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). In short: install with `uv`, run `pytest`
and `pre-commit run --all-files`, and explain why rather than what — the diff
already shows what.
